Act as an experienced highly qualified Senior System Architect and experienced highly qualified Full-Stack Engineer, The project aims to develop a production-ready, end-to-end data collection and payment management application using a React Native (Expo) frontend and a Laravel backend. The system provides centralized, authoritative management of users, suppliers, products, collections, and payments, ensuring data integrity, multi-user and multi-device support, multi-unit quantity tracking, and prevention of duplication or corruption. Core functionality includes full CRUD operations, historical and versioned rate management, multi-unit tracking, advance and partial payment handling, and automated, auditable payment calculations based on prior transactions and historical collections. The architecture adheres to Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, DRY, and KISS practices, with a modular, scalable, and maintainable design, minimal external dependencies, and reliance on native and open-source, LTS-supported libraries. Security is enforced end-to-end with encrypted storage and transmission, robust authentication and authorization via RBAC and ABAC, and transactional backend operations, ensuring accurate, transparent, and auditable financial oversight. The system supports real-world multi-user and multi-device workflows, such as agricultural product collection, enabling concurrent operations, precise calculation of totals, and consistent, reliable data management across all operational scenarios.



Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Principal Systems Architect and design and build a fresh, production-ready, end-to-end data collection and payment management application from the ground up using a React Native (Expo) (\[https://expo.dev](https://expo.dev)) (\[https://reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev)) and a Laravel (\[https://laravel.com](https://laravel.com)). The system must provide centralized, authoritative management of users, suppliers, products, collections, rates, and payments, ensuring strong data integrity, consistency, and reliability across multiple users and multiple devices. It must fully support multi-unit quantity tracking, historical and versioned rate management, full CRUD operations, and automated, auditable payment calculations derived from prior transactions and historical collection data, with strict prevention of duplication, corruption, or inconsistent state. The application should be online-first with robust offline support, persisting data locally during connectivity loss and performing secure, conflict-aware synchronization once online, while preserving accuracy and traceability. The architecture must strictly follow Clean Architecture, SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles, with clear separation of concerns, modular layers, scalable APIs, minimal technical debt, and reliance only on native or well-supported open-source LTS libraries. Implement end-to-end security, including encrypted data at rest and in transit, robust authentication and authorization using RBAC and ABAC, transactional backend operations, comprehensive validation, logging, and audit trails to ensure transparent, verifiable financial oversight. The solution must support real-world concurrent workflows such as agricultural product collection handling simultaneous operations, precise total calculations, and consistent data behavior under all operational scenarios, while remaining scalable, maintainable, performant, and ready for real-world deployment.

Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Principal Systems Architect, Observe All, Offline support must be implemented to ensure uninterrupted data entry and operational continuity. When the application is unavailable to connect to the backend, all submitted data shall be securely persisted in a local database on the device. Once connectivity is restored, the system can reliably synchronize locally stored data with the centralized backend, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and correctness. The synchronization mechanism must support multiple users operating concurrently across multiple devices, with deterministic conflict detection and resolution to prevent data loss, duplication, or corruption. The backend shall remain the authoritative source of truth, validating all incoming data and ensuring that merged records preserve transactional accuracy and historical correctness across all users and devices. Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Principal Systems Architect, Refactor the Application to follow industry best practices, including SOLID principles, DRY, and KISS. The codebase must adhere to Clean Architecture and Clean Code standards, ensuring clear separation of concerns, modularity, scalability, testability, and long-term maintainability. Business logic should be isolated from framework and infrastructure layers, with well-defined interfaces, consistent naming conventions, and minimal coupling between components.
