# Data Collection and Payment Management System

Design and implement a fully functional, production-ready, end-to-end data collection and payment management application using a React Native (Expo) frontend and a Laravel backend. The system must be designed for reliable online operation, with the backend acting as the single authoritative source of truth for all validation, persistence, and business rules. All data must be stored in a centralized database, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and long-term integrity across the entire platform.

The application must fully support CRUD operations for users, suppliers, products, collections, and payments. Supplier management should include detailed profiles, while product and collection management must support multi-unit quantity tracking (e.g., kilograms, grams, units). The system must handle time-based and versioned product rates, ensuring that historical records permanently preserve the exact rate applied at the time of collection, while new records automatically use the latest valid rate. Payment management must support advance payments, partial payments, and final settlements, with all payment calculations fully automated, auditable, and derived exclusively from recorded quantities, applicable rates, and prior transactions.

The solution must support multi-user and multi-device usage, allowing multiple users to work concurrently without data conflicts, duplication, or corruption. Concurrency must be handled deterministically using proper validation, versioning, timestamps, and server-side safeguards to ensure that all concurrent operations preserve data integrity. The system must guarantee that no records are overwritten incorrectly and that all updates are processed predictably and consistently.

Security must be implemented end-to-end, including encrypted data transmission and storage, secure handling of sensitive payment information, transactional backend operations, and comprehensive authentication and authorization. Access control must be enforced using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), ensuring that users can only access data and functionality appropriate to their roles and permissions.

Architecturally, the application must strictly adhere to Clean Architecture principles, SOLID principles, DRY, and KISS. The system must maintain a clear separation of concerns across domain logic, application services, infrastructure, state management, and UI components. The design should prioritize modularity, scalability, testability, high performance, and minimal technical debt. External dependencies must be kept to an absolute minimum, favoring native platform capabilities and relying only on essential, open-source, free, and LTS-supported libraries.

The application must be suitable for real-world business scenarios such as agricultural collection workflows (e.g., tea leaf collection), where users record quantities collected from multiple suppliers, manage advance and partial payments over time, define or update rates periodically, and automatically calculate accurate and transparent totals based on recorded data. The system must ensure reliable financial oversight, precise calculations, and consistent behavior across all users, devices, and operational units.
